# Flow modeling and control employing dynamic mode decomposition and deep reinforcement learning
The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular modeling and analysis approach for fluid
flows. The main idea is the data-based approximation of a linear operator that evolves the flow
state incrementally forward in time. Moreover, the control-enabled extension, DMD with control
(DMDc), allows including the effect of flow actuation in the predictions. Due to its simplicity,
DMDc may be used as an effective surrogate model to accelerate the optimization of control laws
in closed-loop flow control applications.
This project aims to employ an improved version of DMDc, developed at the Institute of Fluid Me -
chanics, TU Dresden, to optimize control laws via deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
